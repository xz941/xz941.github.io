I am a PhD student in Industrial Engineering at Arizona State University, advised by [Hao Yan](http://www.public.asu.edu/~hyan46/). Prior to studying at ASU, I received my M.S. degree in University of Washinton and B.S. degree in Jilin University. 

My research interest primarily focus on developing sequential models for vairous applications. Currently I'm working on the two following projects: building high-dimensional process monitoring system, extracting structured information from air-traffic accident report for safety improvement.
