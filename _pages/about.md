I am a PhD student in Industrial Engineering at Arizona State University, advised by [Hao Yan](http://www.public.asu.edu/~hyan46/). Prior to studying at ASU, I received my M.S. degree in University of Washinton and B.S. degree in Jilin University. 

My research interest lies in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Change Detection and Anomaly Detection. Currently I'm working on the two following projects: building high-dimensional process monitoring system, text mining for improving aviation safety. A copy of my [CV](https://xz941.github.io/assets/CV.pdf) is here.
